In second phase, the Peer_Client will connect to the Relay_Server using the serverâ€™s TCP port already known to
it. After successful connection; it will request the Relay_Server for active Peer_Nodes information (as shown in
Figure 2). The Relay_Server will response to the Peer_Client with the active Peer_Nodes information currently
having with it. On receiving the response message from the Relay_Server, the Peer_Client closes the connection
gracefully.
